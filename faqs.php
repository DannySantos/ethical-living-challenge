        <h3>1. Who can take part?</h3>

        <p>Absolutely anybody! The challenge is designed for 15 to 25 year-olds, but it's really open to anybody who has a desire to deepen their knowledge and live more ethically. Whilst much of the content will be focussed on Australia, most of it isn't location-specific so anybody around the world can take part.</p>

        <h3>2. Does it cost any money?</h3>

        <p>No - the challenge is 100% free because we want to inform and inspire as many people as possible.</p>

        <h3>3. How much time will I have to give up?</h3>

        <p>As much or as little as you like. The project is designed to be flexible because we realise everybody has different commitments. We recommend setting aside half an hour at the same time each morning when you wake up. But if you have a really busy day, don't stress - just save the e-mail and come back to it later.</p>

        <h3>4. What is a regional ambassador?</h3>

        <p>A regional ambassador is someone who engages and inspires people in their local area, mostly in the lead-up to the challenge. This involves encouraging and talking to people who are also doing the challenge, and also engaging the wider community - talking to local papers and other media outlets, contacting schools and universities, writing blog posts and trying to spread the world about the challenge and about ethical living. Ambassadors will be guided through the process and provided with resources along the way. Positions are open to anybody around Australia of any age</p>

        <h3>5. How do I become an ambassador?</h3>

        <p>Click on the &#8216;Apply to be an Ambassador&#8217; link on the homepage. After that, you&#8217;ll have to answer a few questions and then we&#8217;ll get in touch regarding the outcome of your application. Make sure you&#8217;ve signed up to the actual challenge, too!</p>

        <h3>6. Do I get anything in return?</h3>

        <p>Firstly, you receive that warm fuzzy feeling knowing that you're living a bit (or a lot) more ethically than before. Secondly there will be competitions and giveaways throughout the 21 days, and each one will have a winner. So if you're lucky, you could find yourself owning a new organic t-shirt or Fairtrade hot chocolate. Thirdly, you'll receive a leadership action pack and loads of resources which you'll have for life. Finally, if you're selected as a regional ambassador then you can pop it on your CV when you apply for jobs or other roles.</p>

        <h3>7. What happens if I want to discontinue?</h3>

        <p>You can unsubscribe during the challenge via the link at the bottom of the e-mail. Obviously we recommend that you don't though - remember that you can save your e-mails to come back to later.</p>
